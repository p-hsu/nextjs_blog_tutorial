This framework provides (on this very basic level) provides pleny of boiler plate code which is easy to both use and understand.
I'd like to dive more into SSG vs SSR and should read more into their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) before
considering the framework for my next freelance project.

**Some notes:**
- routing using next.js might get a little confusing with API endpoints - consider researching for other tutorials specific to routing
- considering more research into [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
